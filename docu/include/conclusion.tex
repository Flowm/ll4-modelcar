\section{Future Work}
As always there are several possibilities for further improvement of the project.
The most obvious one for an external person is to add control over the main engine of the car.
From a technical perspective, adding sensors to the car for a loop closure would make a real HIL test-bed possible.
This especially in combination with a more advanced control, e.g. ABS, implemented on the panda board, would improve the hole setup.
Furthermore it would enhance the project architecture to export the mqtt class into its own component, which could also setup the the network.
Moreover the mqtt communication could be redesigned so that there is a topic for each possible command, such that every message only consists of a single value.
